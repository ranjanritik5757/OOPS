Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are instances of classes. A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

for example : different libraries such as string , stack , vectors , all of these librarires exist in STL , because of OOPS

objects are entities in the real world and classes are the blueprint of the entities . For example , suppose a car manufacturing company firstly creates a blueprint of a car and then starts creating the actual cars using the model , in this case the car is the object and blueprint of the car is class.

a class contains different properties and methods

Access Modifiers : Access modifiers are keywords used in object-oriented programming languages to set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members
There are three types of access modifiers : private , public , member.

By default all the attributes and methods in the class are private in nature. 

Private class : Members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared (not possible to access derived classes).
Public class : Members declared as public are accessible from any other code. There are no restrictions on their visibility.
Protected class : : Members declared as protected are accessible within their own class, derived classes.


suppise in a class , there exist a private
